Want to scheduling sprints more than an hour in advance, or set up multiple sprints in a row? You can use Carl-bot for this purpose. Sprinto may get a built-in way in future, but for now there's Carl-bot, a popular Discord bot which is developed completely independently of Sprinto (I have nothing to do with it!)

# Scheduling Sprints with Carl-bot

Setup:

0. Invite Sprinto to your server â€” see [[Setup]]

1. Invite Carl-bot to your Discord server by clicking "+ Invite" at [carl.gg](https://carl.gg/)

  Tip: Be sure you're logged in at discord.com.

  Tip: Carl-bot does not require any special permissions to interact with Sprinto. So, if you're not using Carl-bot for other purposes, you can leave them all unchecked.

2. Tell Sprinto it's OK to listen to Carl-bot in each sprinting channel: `/setup-set-listen-to-carl setting:On` (otherwise Sprinto ignores all messages from all bots)

Scheduling a Sprint with Carl-bot, use the `autofeeds silent` command:

example:

`/autofeeds silent` duration:`24h` message:`<@421646775749967872> sprint in a bit for 30`

You also can edit or add autofeeds, and set how often they recur, in the Carl-bot dashboard: [carl.gg](https://carl.gg/). 

See Carl-bot's autofeed documentation for more: 

* https://docs.carl.gg/utilities/announcements/

Notes:

* Use `/setup-set-listen-to-carl` setting:`On` or `@Sprinto _setListenToCarl on` in every Sprint channel where you might schedule a sprint
* `<@421646775749967872>` becomes `@Sprinto`. But writing it like this (with Sprinto's ID) is more reliable than just typing `@Sprinto`
* Set your time zone via the dashboard at https://carl.gg 
* Sprinto will not prevent someone other than Carl-bot running another conflicting Sprint which runs over the scheduled start time.
* When running chain sprints (back to back sprints), be mindful of the "end time" to finish up Sprint. You can set this manually to make it more predictable. (And you might want to give another minute between sprints to be sure they don't overlap). For example, this sprint gives 5 minutes for word counts: `_sprint in 2 for 15 endtime 5`
* If you work out some commands for scheduling a nice series sprints, feel free to share it on the Sprinto discord server. I would like to add more examples or tips to this doc. 
* Use `/setup-pingroles-set` role:`@role` to have Sprinto always ping a role when a new sprint is announced. See: [SprintMC: Always ping a role at sprint start](SprintMC#always-ping-a-role-at-sprint-start)

Please do not abuse the bots. Don't, for example, schedule very large numbers of sprints that you don't intend for anyone to join. Abuse may lead to your account and/or your Discord server being barred from using Sprinto.

If you'd like to use another scheduling bot other than carl-bot, please suggest it on the Sprinto discord or with the `/feedback` command. Unfortunately "reminder-bot" can't be used (Sprinto can't see its webhook-style reminder messages).
