## Popular and fun ways to start a sprint

→ see also: _[[Sprint command explained|Sprint]]_ (with full list of sprint options and presets)

| Command | Longer alternative | Description |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| `/sprint` | `/sprint for 15 in 1` | Start a sprint for the default duration (15 minutes, starting in 1 minute) |
| `/sprint 10` | `/sprint for 10` | Start a 10 minute sprint (can change it to up to 60 minutes) |
| `/sprint in 5` | `/sprint for 15 in 5` | Start a sprint in 5 minutes time. |
| `/sprint 20 5` | `/sprint for 20 in 5` | |
| `/sprint :45 ` | `/sprint for 15 at :45` | It's easier for sprinters to keep track if the start and end times line up with clock time. |
| `/sprint iab` | `/sprint for 15 mins in a bit` | Sprinto will find a nice time to start the sprint in the next 2½ to 7½ minutes (an increment of 5 minutes). |
| `/sprint quick` | `/sprint for 5 in 30 endtime 90s` | Start a 5 minute sprint in 30 seconds, also with reduced time to give your final word count. |
| `/sprint hel` | `/sprint for however long in 1 min` | Sprinto spins the wheel and starts a Sprint usually between 10 and 25 minutes, with a tiny chance of being around 5 or 40 minutes. You can also combine this, e.g. `/sprint hel iab` |
| `/sprint marathon` | `/sprint for 60 in 7.5 to 12.5 mins endtime 10` | Sprint a marathon after a bit for 60 minutes; 10 minutes for your final word count) |

## Oops?

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/cancel` | If Sprinto didn't understand your `/sprint` command you can cancel it and start over. Note that if others have joined your sprint, you might need them to `/cancel` too. |

## Join a sprint
Join once a sprint is started. 

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/join` | Join the active sprint (with no starting words). Note: You must join your own sprint too. |
| `/join 10000` | Join with 10,000 words (This is the word count of the document you're working on) |
| `/join same` | Join with your last word count (e.g. from your previous sprint) |

## Some different ways to declare or update your word count
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/words 10150` | When time's up, declare the word count of your document is now 10,150. If you started with 0 words, your word count might look more like `/words 150`. |
| `/words -` | At the end of a sprint you may wish to simply leave your word count unchanged. Don't forget the dash `-` without it, Sprinto will just show your current word count. |
| `/words 150 new` | If you know how many _new_ words you've written, but perhaps changed documents or lost track of your starting word count, you can just declare how many of your words are `new` (written during the sprint). Use `/words 0 new` to reset your word count. |
| `/words +50` or `/words add 50` | Add another 50 new words to your count. Perhaps from your second manuscript. |
| `/words 10150 final` | Give your final word count early, before the sprint is over. This way Sprinto won't wait for another `/words` from you after time's up. |
| `/join 15000` | You can rejoin a sprint with a different number of starting words before giving your word count with `/words`. Sometimes it's easier. |
| `/join just 200 final` | Late to the party? Forgot to join? Dive-bomb in just before the finish line with just your final tally and surprise everyone! You can't use this to join a sprint before it's fully underway. |
| Why are there so many commands? | The top one is all you need to use. The rest are just for your convenience. |
